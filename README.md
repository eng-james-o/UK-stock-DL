# UK-stock-DL

Prediction of the UK stock market via the FTSE-100 index using deep learning models. A variety of deep learning models are used here and will be updated to cover as many deep learning approaches as possible.

## CNN-LSTM Hybrid models
## GRU model
## GRU+Attention mechanism

## To implement
GAN models and Transformers will be implemented. Hybrids of various RNNs will be explored as well as CNNs, which could be used to generate trading signals from historical stock data. This project will also expand to mine textual data from news feed for additional features to inform the models.
